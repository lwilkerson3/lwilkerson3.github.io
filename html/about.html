        <p>
            Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Lucas Wilkerson, and I'm 
            a computer science student who loves to build things. I made this 
            site using HTML and CSS and I also have significant experience with 
            C/C++, Python, JavaScript, SQL, as well as game engines such as 
            Unity and Godot. I'm constantly learning new things about lots of 
            different tech topics and am excited to join the work force to 
            continue my computer science education.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a programmer, I love to solve problems and build things that 
            people can use. Whether it's a game, a web application, or a piece 
            of software, I'm always striving to make things that are both 
            functional and beautiful.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not programming, I enjoy playing strategy games, reading 
            sci-fi and fantasy novels. I also enjoy working on my own games and 
            have self-published two so far on the Google and Amazon app stores.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, I'm a passionate and driven programmer who loves to build 
            things. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to 
            learn and grow, so feel free to reach out if you'd like to 
            collaborate or just chat about technology!
